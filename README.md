The Explanation of my Dashboard
In this dashboard project, I created a comprehensive Sales Dashboard for BLINK IT that visualizes key performance metrics and provides meaningful insights into sales trends. I used a variety of visual elements such as pie charts, bar charts, donut charts, and line graphs to represent data clearly and effectively. I analyzed total sales by item ratings, item fat content, outlet location types, outlet sizes, and item types. Additionally, I incorporated summary metrics like total sales, average sales, and average rating to give a quick overview of overall performance. By segmenting the data in multiple ways, I enabled better understanding of customer preferences and outlet effectiveness, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions. This dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of where sales are coming from and which factors are contributing the most to overall performance.
